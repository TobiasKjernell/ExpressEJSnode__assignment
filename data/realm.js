const midgard = new Realm(`The Norse hail from the northern kingdom of Midgard, comprising the modern-day region of Scandinavia. They are generally stocky in build, strong, and not quite as civilized as inhabitants of the other Realms. However, when it comes to fighting, the Norse are equaled by none. Traditionally, the races of Midgard do not cooperate fully, but in this time of conquest and danger, they have put aside their differences to fight their common enemies. The Norse races are the standard human Viking, the large strong Troll, the short hardy Dwarf, and the small crafty Kobold.

Norse magic comes almost exclusively from their gods, from Odin, Thor, and Hel. Trolls and Kobolds can also choose to become the wild Shaman, a primitive mental-based magic user.

The Vikings are the humans of Midgard, and as such are tall, hale, hardy, but generally not as civilized as humans from other Realms. The Trolls are large fearsomely strong creatures who make great fighters. The Dwarves are stocky and wise, making good priests and fighters. The Kobolds are smaller than dwarves, but much quicker and more dexterous.

Ours is the harshest of lands, and we are bred from strife and hardship. Aye, and our power is the power of the old gods - of Odin and Thor and all the Aesir - and of the Jotun, the great giants of lore. Norseman, Troll, Dwarf, Kobold, and our more recent allies the Valkyn and Frostalf, have joined knowledge and strength to unite the mighty forces of Midgard, and we all look upon the rich lands of Hibernia and Albion with some eagerness and hunger. They are soft and weak and spoiled by easy lives, and we mean to take their green lands for our own. Our weapons are sharp, our warriors fearless, and we carry the gods' own magic in our hearts as well as our swords and axes. We will crush those who think to stand against us. Our warriors will perform countless heroic deeds, songs will spring up like stars in the heavens, and those that fell will find their place in the glorious halls of Valhalla. Truth is power, and power truth. Remember that, and lift your sword high in defens of Midgard!`,
