//Classes
const shaman = new CharacterClass('Range', 'Shaman', ['Cloth', 'Leather', 'Studded', 'Chain'], [], ['Staff', 'Hammer', 'Shield'], `Patrons of Ymir, the ancient god whose body comprises the world of Midgard, Shaman are tribal spellcasters who specialize in a variety of healing and combat magic. Their healing abilities are primitive in comparison with the cultured Healer class, but good enough to serve as a primary healer in a group when needed. They are best known for their buffing abilities. They have a large selection of buffs they use to enhance the battle abilities of their comrades. As with most classes, the Shaman is not without an offensive option. The Shaman has a spell line, which composes primarily of fungal magic and damage-over-time spells, which slowly decompose the bodies of the enemy. They rely on their tribal training to guide them into battle.`);
const warlock = new CharacterClass('Range', 'Warlock', ['Cloth'], [], ['Staff'], `Originating from a cult that lived underground in caves beneath the Realm of Midgard, Warlocks are cloth-wearing worshipers of Hel who have mastered the art of spell weaving. They have three magic specializations: Cursing, Hexing and Witchcraft.
Warlocks are unique among magic users in that their spells come in 4 types that can function differently from traditional spells. The four types of spells they employ are: Primary spells, Secondary Spells, Spell Primers, and Spell Chambers. Primary Spells Function much like any other spells and can be cast at any time. Secondary Spells are similar to Primary spells, but require a Spell Primer to be active before one is able to cast a Secondary Spell. Spell Primers are instant cast Self-Buff spells that alter the functioning of a Secondary Spell (note that only one Primer can be active at any given time and are automatically replaced with any subsequent primers cast). Spell Chambers are spells with a long cast times (unaffected by dexterity) that are stored in Runic Orbs that float above the warlock for instant use later. Only one of each Spell Chamber can be summoned ahead of time and are expended when used.`);
const healer = new CharacterClass('Range', 'Healer', ['Cloth', 'Leather', 'Studded', 'Chain'], [], ['Staff', 'Hammer', 'Shield'], `Followers of Eir, the Norse goddess of healing, Healers aid their comrades in battle with a variety of healing and buffing magic as well as very powerful crowd controlling spells. Despite their strong ability to heal, mesmerize, and stun those who come before them, they have little to no offensive abilities. Healers are blessed with their strong spell-working, yet are only capable of swinging a hammer at their enemies if they come too closely. As a Healer, one must learn to stand in the back of the battle and watch from the edge while the warriors of the realm rush in for blood and vengeance for wrongful acts against their forefathers. Ahh, but there are some Healers that make the rush with their realm-mates... primarily stunning the enemy with their amazing good looks and charm.`)
const valkyrie = new CharacterClass('Melee', 'Valkyrie', ['Cloth', 'Leather', 'Studded', 'Chain'], [], ['Staff', 'Sword', 'Spear', 'Shield'], `The Order of the Valkyries was started by two stunningly beautiful orphaned twin sisters named Sigrun and Brynhild, who since childhood claimed to be able to hear the voices of the honored dead speaking to them from Valhalla. The voices warned the sisters from an early age that a time of great crisis would soon face the denizens of Midgard, and commanded them to build the Order of Valkyries to lead the defense of the realm against Albion and Hibernia. Norse, Frostalf, and Dwarven women who choose to be Valkyries are trained to fight using both melee and magic to damage their enemies. They can use swords, shields, and spears, and they have special styles in each line available only to the Order of the Valkyries. Their magic line, Odin's Will, primarily uses Cone Area Effect (CAE) spells, a new spell type that affects every enemy in front of the Valkyrie who is in range of the spell.`);
const spiritmaster = new CharacterClass('Range', 'Spiritmaster', ['Cloth'], [], ['Staff'], `Spiritmasters are a primary casting class in the Midgardian realm. They derive their power from the Queen of the Norse underworld, Hel. Her divine grace provides the Spiritmaster with the ability to summon the spirits of Midgard soldiers from the underworld to the surface to aid in the continuing battle against the infidels of Albion and Hibernia.
They carry with them the ability to debuff and control large crowds of enemies with their area effect mesmerize spells. They also have the ability to buff their spirit fighters.

Spiritmasters have 3 specialization paths with differing levels of utility depending upon the situation. For solo PvE, the summoning specialization line is excellent for quick leveling. WIth a fully buffed pet a summoning spec SM can "solo" many epic mobs. Summoning specialized Spiritmasters are considered very weak in RvR. For solo RvR, the darkness specialization line is the most appropriate. The darkness line grants multiple area-effect mesmerization spells, a DEX/QUI debuff, and the lifetap spec nuke which is the primary damage spell. The suppression specialization works very well in group based PvE and RvR due to the high damage point-blank area-effect spell and the STR/CON debuff and is used to form the basis of "bomb groups". Suppression Spritmasters will not find much success with solo RvR.`);
const warrior = new CharacterClass('Melee', 'Warrior', ['Cloth', 'Leather', 'Studded', 'Chain'], [], ['Sword', 'Axe', 'Hammer', 'Two-Handed Weapon', 'Shield', 'Throw'], "The fighting class of Midgard, Warriors are provided strength by Tyr, the Norse god of battle. Warriors have no magical abilities; instead they are the masters of weapons and armor. Able to use one and two handed weapons equally well, Warriors are also skilled with shield and parry. Courageous in battle, Warriors strike fear into their enemies and protect their weaker realm members from harm. They have little fear of other fighters, but an enemy mage can be their downfall.")
const berserker = new CharacterClass('Melee', 'Berserker', ['Cloth', 'Leather', 'Studded'], [], ['Sword', 'Hammer', 'Axe', 'Two Handed Weapon', 'Left-Handed Weapon', 'Throw'], `Patrons of Modi, the Norse god of battle-rage, Berserkers are light tanks who eschew heavy armor and rely on wielding two weapons at once. Their heavy training in weapons helps them deal powerful amounts of damage when in battle. They have the ability to call upon their god, Modi, and transform into a giant beast. This is called "Berserk" and makes each hit that lands a critical hit. It comes with the sacrifice of all defensive abilities, but is so powerful and frightening in battle that it is considered worth the price to this fierce fighter.`)
const savage = new CharacterClass('Melee', 'Savage', ['Cloth', 'Leather', 'Studded'], [], ['Hand-To-Hand', 'Hammer', 'Sword', 'Axe', 'Two Handed Weapon'], `The Savage is a studded-armor wearing fighter who disdains normal weapons in favor of hand-to-hand combat. Savages aren't interested in mastering the art of complicated weapons - instead they affix simple sharp or bladed weapons to their hands and swing away.
Savages follow the Valkyn god of war, Kelgor, who represents bloodlust and the battlefield. Kelgor has been adopted by the Norse gods, especially Modi and Odin, as a brother-in-arms so long as the Valkyn continue assisting the Norse in their fight against the Morvaltar.
The Savage receives a weapon skill called "Hand to Hand". In general, the Savage's hand to hand weapons attach to his hands and can deal out slashing or thrusting damage. H2H is a dual-weapon skill, in that it allows the Savage to wield two weapons at the same time. However, it is set up differently from the dual wield/left axe skills that are currently in the game. H2H will always attack with the right hand by default. When the skill "fires", then the Savage will hit with both hands in that round. Please note that at higher levels, Savages have the chance of hitting more than twice per round.
In addition to a number of different weapon types, the Savage can learn special H2H combat styles as he specs up in the H2H spec - some of these combat styles allow the Savage to attack more than one enemy in the same round. The Savage also can specialize in a set of combat abilities called "Savagery", which allow the Savage to modify his combat chances, such as chance to evade, parry, buff attack speed or DPS, and also convert hit points to endurance. Most Savagery abilities take a percentage of your base hitpoints when they wear off or are refreshed.`);
const thane = new CharacterClass('Melee', 'Thane', ['Cloth', 'Leather', 'Studded', 'Chain'], [], ['Sword, Hammer', 'Axe', 'Two Handed Weapons', 'Shield'], `A Thane is a worshiper of the Norse God of Thunder and Lightning. Thor is probably the most famous of all the Norse gods know for his protection of Midgard using Mjolnir his mighty hammer, and the power of the storms rage to defeat any danger to Midgard. The character of a Thane draws upon both the Magic of Lightning and the Strength of Melee combat to defend Midgard. Thanes belong to the Viking Profession, but are part of the Hybrid grouping of characters; they attack their enemies through the use of Lightning when their foe is at range, and their Strength and Melee Weapons once they reach their target. Thanes are eventually able to use the best armor available to Midgard, and any Midgard weapon save the Spear, Hand-to-hand Devices of the Savages and Thrown Weapons.`);

const norseman = new Race('Norseman', [warrior, berserker, thane, valkyrie, healer], '70', '70', '50', '50', '60', '2% Crush', '3% Slash', '5% Cold', "", `The Norse are the common men and women of Midgard. Tall and strong, they love the snow and ice of the native land. Norsemen are very adaptable, and can be found in almost any position of the armies of Midgard, from the stealthy Shadowblades attacking the enemy by surprise, to the stalwart Healers keeping their compatriots alive and well.`);
const troll = new Race('Troll', [warrior, berserker, thane, shaman], '100', '70', '35', '35', '60', '3% Slash', '2% Thrust', '5% Matter', "", `To some, the Trolls are furious creatures of myth and legend... yet to others, the Trolls are stalwart allies and faithful comrades of war. It all depends on which side of the battlefield you're on.
Huge, strong and slow, Trolls dominate the battlefield with their great physical strength, although a few Trolls have also been known to dabble in the primitive mystical arts.`);

Although Dwarves originally hailed from underneath the earth, today they live alongside the other races of Midgard.`);
const kobold = new Race('Kobold', [warrior, berserker, warlock, shaman], '50', '50', '70', '70', '60', '5% Crush', '5% Energy', "", "", `Mischievous, quick, and small, the Kobolds often act as scouts for the armies of Midgard, although many also have an affinity for the mystical runic arts. A few even serve as warriors on the front lines of battle, where their great speed and dexterity make up for their diminutive size.`);

const frostalf = new Race('Frostalf', [thane, spiritmaster, valkyrie, warlock, healer, shaman], '55', '55', '55', '60', '75', '2% Slash', '3% Thrust', '5% Spirit', "", `The origins of the Frostalf date back many generations to the time of the twin Svartalfar princes, Hauk and Enar, who, when their parents both died suddenly, were left to determine who should rule. One, and only one, could rule the kingdom, but they did not know which twin was the firstborn and therefore the rightful ruler. Into this situation came a human stranger. Being unfriendly to strangers, the Svartalfar meant to imprison the traveler. But the stranger suggested that if he could but speak with the princes, he could offer a solution to their dilemma - a trial of combat and magical craftsmanship - in exchange for his freedom. However, the stranger was treacherous, and sabotaged Enar's artifact during the competition. With further treachery, he carefully laid the blame on Hauk. In the ensuing disruption, Hauk left the kingdom with a few of his followers. The stranger disappeared with the kingdom's treasured artifacts, and Enar became the ruler, but was terribly remorseful at having falsely accused his brother. However, despite Enar's pleas, Hauk decided to remain where he had settled, in Niflheim - a place of darkness, bitter cold and icy fogs and mists. It was the lowest level of the universe. Generations later, Hauk's descendents came to be known as the Frostalfs, and they were recently discovered by a band of dwarves seeking a way to bolster the forces of Midgard. Realizing that their fate was still bound with that of Midgard, the Frostalfs have agreed to come to the aid of the Realm and fight side by side with Midgard's forces. With naturally high Piety they are especially suitable as Spiritmasters, Runemasters, Bonedancer, Healers and Shamans.`);
